            <div><p><b>CHATBOT</b> <br>
                <br>
            <b>Description:</b> This chatbot project demonstrates a conversational AI built to provide weather updates and engage in small talk. The chatbot can understand and respond to queries about the weather in various cities and handle general interactions like greetings, help requests, and casual conversation. It's designed to be user-friendly and can be easily integrated into a web application or any Python-based project, making it a versatile addition to any portfolio. <br>

            <b>Tools and Technologies Used</b> <br>
            <b>Python:</b> The primary programming language used for developing the chatbot. <br>
            <b>SpaCy:</b> An open-source software library for advanced natural language processing. SpaCy is used for entity recognition to extract city names from user inputs. <br>
            <b>NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):</b> A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. NLTK is used for pattern matching in the chatbotâ€™s predefined responses. <br>
           <b> OpenWeatherMap API:</b> This API provides weather data, including current weather, forecasts, and historical data to retrieve weather information based on city names. <br>
            <b>Project Features</b> <br>
            <b>Weather Query Handling:</b> Users can ask about the weather in various cities, and the chatbot fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. <br>
            <b>Small Talk Capabilities:</b> The chatbot can engage in general conversations, responding to greetings, inquiries about its creator, and other predefined questions. <br>
           <b> Natural Language Understanding:</b> Utilizes SpaCy for extracting relevant entities (e.g., city names) from user input. <br>
            This project showcases the integration of natural language processing and various Python libraries to create a functional and interactive chatbot. It is an excellent example of applying various technologies to solve real-world problems and enhance user experience. <br>
            
            <b>Note:</b> The chatbot project itself is not currently hosted online but can be easily deployed using platforms like PythonAnywhere or incorporated into a web application.
